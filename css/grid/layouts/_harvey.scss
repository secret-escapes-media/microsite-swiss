// Harvey is Bob's second cousin on his Mother's side. He was a troubled
// youth and, after years of medical examination Harvey was diagnosed with
// multipersonality disorder. It is this disorder which allows him to build
// the following two sided image/text layouts.
// Harvey is a 50/50 text image layout with no gutter. Use Harvey to make
// an alternating full width section with centred text, and limited height
// image sizing so the layout works across screens and sizes.
